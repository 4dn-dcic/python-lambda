Python-lambda is everything you need to start developing your own microservices
using AWS Lambda.

Description
===========

AWS Lambda is a service that allows you to write Python, Java, or Node.js code that gets executed in response to events like http requests or files uploaded to S3. While working with Lambda is relatively easy, the process of developing, bundling, and deploying your code is not as simple as it could be and for this I offer you Python-Lambda.

Python-Lambda aims to take away the guest work of developing your Lambda microservices through a command-line utility to initialize new projects, test and run your code locally, bundle your project, and deploy it to the cloud.
